<h1> SWE 430 Exercise 1 --- Password Checker</h1>

<h2>
Exercise 1 Instructions
</h2>

<p>
Use test-driven development (TDD) along with qUnit, the xUnit testing framework, to implement the password checker code module (defined below) for a DoD information system.  Ensure you write the unit test before writing the code to pass the unit test (write test => check if test fails => write production code => run all unit tests => refactor => run tests => go to next test case).  
</p>

<p>
Turn in both the source code (code.coffee) and the unit tests (test.coffee) on blackboard Exercise 1 Submission.  If you have any questions, run into problems, or need clarification, please let me know.  Your production code will be evaluated by running it against a set of reference test cases (written according to the specification).  Your unit test cases will be evaluate by using them to test a faulty implementation.
</p>

<h2>
Password Checker Specification
</h2>

<p>
The check function in the password module determines if a proposed password is valid or not.  Function signature:  String X list of Strings => boolean X String
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    Inputs: a proposed password and an array of 0 to 6 previous passwords.
    </li>
    <li>
    Output: A 2 element list containing a boolean and a String.  The boolean is true if the proposed password is valid, false otherwise.  When the boolean is false, the String provides the reason the password is invalid.  When the boolean is true, second value is the empty string: <code> "" </code>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
Precondition:  All previous passwords are assumed to be valid (you don't have to test that the previous passwords are valid, only test the proposed password.)  Example usage:
</p>


<div class="code">
<pre class="prettyprint">
proposed_password = 'P@55W*rd'
previous_passwords = ['aaAA11!!', 'bbBB22@@']
[result, reason] = password.check(proposed_password, previous_passwords)
</pre> </div>

<p>The result variable would evaluate to true and the reason would be <code>""</code>; the empty string.</p>


<div class="code">
<pre class="prettyprint">
proposed_password = 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaBB22##'
previous_passwords = ['aaAA11!!', 'bbBB22@@']
[result, reason] = password.check(proposed_password, previous_passwords)
</pre> </div>

<p>In this case, the result variable would evaluate to false and the reason would be <code>"too long"</code>.  Even though the password fails 2 rules, <code>"too long"</code> and <code>"4+ char substring"</code>, only the reason for the first failure (according to the order listed below) is reported.</p>

<p> The only global variable your code should export is an object (which will serve as a module) named password which contains a function named check.  This is accomplished in the same way we export the target object which contains both the Target and the Grid classes in Example 1. </p>


<div class="code">
<div class="filename"> <span class="filename"> code.coffee </span> </div>
<pre class="prettyprint">
window.password = {}
password.check = (proposed_password, previous_passwords) ->
    # body of function goes here
    # ...
</pre> </div>

<p>
In order to be declared "valid," all accepted passwords must adhere to the following criteria:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
    A password must be at least 8 (<span class="reason">too short</span>) and no more than 20 characters long (<span class="reason">too long</span>).
</li>
<li>
    A password is comprised of only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> printable characters.  No whitespcae---tabs, space, etc., control characters, or unicode is allowed (<span class="reason">not printable ASCII</span>).
</li>
<li>
    Each password must contain:
    <ul>
    <li>
         2 or more upper-case letters (<span class="reason">upper-case</span>)
    </li>
    <li>
         2 or more lower-case letters (<span class="reason">lower-case</span>)
    </li>
    <li>
         2 or more digit characters (0-9) (<span class="reason">digit</span>)
    </li>
    <li>
         2 or more non-alphanumeric characters (<span class="reason">non-alphanumeric</span>)
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>
    A password cannot be similar to any of the user's previous six passwords.
      "Similar to" is defined as having any of the following:
    <ul>
    <li>
        6 or more of the same characters anywhere in the two passwords (<span class="reason">6+ same chars</span>)
        <ul>
        <li>
            Example: aaaaaaAA11!! and aaOO22@@aaa are not similar
        </li>
        <li>
            Example: aaaaaaAA11!! and <span class="bad">aaa</span>OO22@@<span class="bad">aaa</span> are similar
        </li>
        <li>
            Example: <span class="bad">aoAO12</span>!! and <span class="bad">oa</span>@<span class="bad">O1A</span>@<span class="bad">2</span> are similar
        </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        4 or more of the same characters in the same relative position 
        from the start of the password 
        (<span class="reason">4+ chars in same position</span>)
        <ul>
        <li>
            Example: aAaA!1!1 and oAoA@1@2 are not similar
        </li>
        <li>
            Example: a<span class="bad">A</span>a<span class="bad">A</span>!<span class="bad">1</span>!<span class="bad">1</span> and o<span class="bad">A</span>o<span class="bad">A</span>@<span class="bad">1</span>@<span class="bad">1</span> are similar
        </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Any identical 4-character substring 
        (<span class="reason">4+ char substring</span>)
        <ul>
        <li>
            Example: aaAA11!! and AA12oo@@ are not similar
        </li>
        <li>
            Example: aa<span class="bad">AA11</span>!! and <span class="bad">AA11</span>oo@@ are similar
        </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The appropriate "reason string" for each rule is shown in parentheses and in green.  The check() function only returns one reason for a password failure.  If a password fails multiple rules, only the reason for the first rule failed, according to the order listed above, is returned by the function.  Be sure to use the exact reason strings listed above---they are case sensitive.
