old notes
==========

Provide a web-based IDE to eliminate the use of notepad
Use smaller language (subset of coffeescript, scheme)



BLACKBOARD
============

content collection -> class name
upload package -> website.zip (overwrite)
ensure folders have public read permission set
    or just link to a top level file?
content collection -> class name -> click on permissions column for pertinent file
Permit Anyone -> read only -> submit
    -> adds read permission to public group

Course copy
-----------
Packages and utilities -> course copy


Enroll user
-----------
Users and Group -> Users ->


Navigation menu
-------------
Top left + sign
    -> Tool link:  Announcements and Contacts (in type)
    -> content area:  everything else (emaxs, lessons, exercises, admin info)


Content Area
------------------
Build content -> File -> single link item (html, zip)
Build content -> Item -> multi-link item + title [+ description]
    very similar to new page...
Assessment -> Test:  build an exam; can upload questions in one shot using excel tab delimited ASCII text format

Assessment -> do unlimited attempts
    to grade -> grade center -> view grade details
    (top right 'v' in assignment box) clear attempt or ignore attempt
