SWE 430 Tutorial 3:  Environment Instructions
========================================================================

Each example and assignment has an associated environment.
The environment allows you to work through the examples interactively;
building the same software as in the examples.
The environment runs entirely within your web browser;
there is no need to install any software.
Likewise, for the assignments there are also associated environments
which allow you to complete the assignments without having to install
any software on your computer.

For each example, open the environment and use it to work each step of
the example as you read through it.
**It is important that you actually work through the example yourself,
typing each step of the test and production JavaScript code and running
your unit tests each time you make a change.
The examples were designed to be worked out, not merely read through.
If you take the time to work the examples,
you will be well prepared to complete the assignments on which you will
be graded.**
You will also need the appropriate environment to work each assignment.
The assignments are graded.  When you complete each assignment,
you will turn in your modified test code and production code JavaScript
files (the files ending in .js) or the jsbin identifiers in the
corresponding assignment link on blackboard.


Local zip Environment or Web-based jsbin Environment
----------------------------------------------------

You have the option of using one of two environments.
There is a local zip file environment as well as an alternative
web-based environment using jsbin.
For instructions using the zip environment, see
[zip Environment Instructions](zip-instructions.html).
For instructions using jsbin, see
[jsbin Instructions](jsbin-instructions.html).
Either use the .zip file environment or the jsbin environment---you
only need one.
I'm providing the alternative jsbin environments for those who may be
stuck using Internet Explorer 6/7 and Notepad.
If that is your situation,
and you find it onerous working through the examples and assignments,
you may enjoy jsbin more.
It essentially provides an integrated,
web-based text editor and console.
If you have a reasonable text editor,
it will likely be easier to use the .zip file environment,
as all the files will be local and you will not have to deal with
network latency.
