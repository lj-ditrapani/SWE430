Assignment 1
========================================================================

In this assignment, you will apply what you learned in Example 1.
You will incrementally write code while iteratively running the
associated tests at each step.

For Assignment 1, you will create a module named `baiscMath`
with the following 4 functions:

<table>
<tr><th>Function</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>add(a, b)</td><td>Add the values of a and b.</td></tr>
<tr><td>subtract(a, b)</td><td>Subtract the value of b from a.</td></tr>
<tr><td>multiply(a, b)</td><td>Multiply a and b.</td></tr>
<tr><td>divide(a, b)</td><td>Divide a by b.</td></tr>
</table>

The test code has already been written for you.
Write the code to pass the tests incrementally.
At each step, re-run the tests.
Use the tests to help guide your implementation of the `basicMath`
module as we did in Example 1 when creating the `stringInfo` module.
