SWE 430 Syllabus
========================================================================


Welcome!
--------

Welcome to SWE 430: Software Implementation!  I am happy to have you in my class.  This offering presents new material that centers on modern software implementation best practices such as test-driven development, automated unit testing, and refactoring.  The content will be more technical than you may be used to from previous SWE offerings.  The format of the course takes a hands-on approach, focusing on examples and assignments.  I hope you enjoy the course as much as I have enjoyed developing the content!

The first week of the course lays the necessary conceptual foundations.  You will read 3 lessons, answer 3 discussion board questions, and accomplish 3 tutorials.  The week ends with a short example and assignment on running tests iteratively and coding incrementally which will prepare you for full-blow test-driven development.

In the second week, you will work through an example of TDD and then complete a short TDD assignment.  The TDD example provides a concrete instantiation of the concepts you learned in week 1 and the assignment gives you the opportunity to apply the concepts on your own.  Week 2 concludes
 with a Progress Check that covers lessons 1-3.

The final week allows you to apply all that you have learned in a capstone TDD assignment.

The majority of the time you spend on the class will be in working through the two examples and the three assignments.


Where to Start?
---------------

Flow of the course:

- Finish reading this syllabus.
- Then post an introduction of yourself on the discussion board.
- Next, go to the [Index Page](index.html) and complete the work for week 1.


Learning Objectives
-------------------

1. Understand the impact of decisions made in selecting construction tools and processes.
2. Detail software artifacts produced during and in support of construction.
3. Analyze software construction artifacts for standards compliance and errors.
4. Evaluate the conversion of low-level design artifacts into a software solution.
5. Trace elements of a software solution to requirements and test cases.
6. Assess the effectiveness of unit and interface test cases.
7. Analyze methods of improving software assurance.
8. Identify steps involved in construction and debugging processes.
9. Assess various sources for obtaining software artifacts.


Evaluation
----------

You will primarily be evaluated on the work you turn in for Assignments 1-3.  You will also be evaluated through the Discussion Board Questions and the Progress Check.  The points possible for each evaluated item is listed below.

<table summary="Points possible for each graded item">
<tr><th>Item</th><th>Points Possible</th></tr>
<tr><td>Introduction</td><td>05</td></tr>
<tr><td>3 Discussion Board Questions</td><td>15</td></tr>
<tr><td>Assignment 1 </td><td>05</td></tr>
<tr><td>Assignment 2 </td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Assignment 3 </td><td>60</td></tr>
<tr><td>Progress Check</td><td>10</td></tr>
</table>

The bulk of your grade depends on the assignments, so please be sure to give yourself plenty of time to complete them.  Assignment 3 will take approximately nine hours to complete.  You need at least 75 points to pass the class.


Due Dates
---------

Meeting the recommended turn-in dates will allow you to progress smoothly through the course, requiring about 8 hours per week.  The deadlines are there to ensure I have enough time to grade everyone's work. If I don't have enough time to grade your work, I cannot give you a fair assessment.  If you wait until the deadlines to do the work, you will find you have a disproportionate amount of work to do the last week.  Following the recommended turn-in dates will give you a more pleasant experience in the course.

<tr><td>3 Discussion Board Questions</td>

AFIT Policies
-------------

These are key Air University, AFIT and LS policies that will be observed by both students and faculty.

<h3>Withdraws and Transfers</h3>

We understand that work and personal conflicts may arise, and we want to be as flexible as possible in helping you complete the course in light of these constraints. If you see a potential conflict surfacing, **please let me know as soon as possible** so we can be proactive in
resolving it while sufficient trade space still exists to do so. **We will need to get approval from your immediate supervisor** before we can withdraw you from the course or transfer you to our next offering.

<h3>Academic Freedom and Non-Attribution</h3>

Effective learning requires an open exchange of ideas. Policies of academic freedom and non-attribution create an environment where students and faculty are able to engage in a meaningful dialogue without fear of retribution. A policy of academic freedom means that faculty and students may express their opinions concerning current or proposed policies, regulations and procedures openly, honestly, and professionally. It does not mean that one may attack the character, personality, or other personal attributes of an individual. Personal attacks will not be tolerated. A policy of non-attribution means what you say in class will not be attributed to you, if and when your thoughts or ideas are repeated outside of class.

<h3>Academic Integrity and Cheating</h3>

You are prohibited from engaging in plagiarism, cheating, misrepresentation, unprofessional relationships, or any other act constituting a lack of academic integrity. The use of any unauthorized assistance to complete any task or assignment that is evaluated for purposes of establishing a student's grade is absolutely prohibited. Providing unauthorized assistance to another individual is likewise prohibited. Such actions may result in immediate termination of the offender's enrollment and dismissal from class.

<h3>Harassment</h3>

No individual under any circumstances should be subjected to harassment. A hostile environment is detrimental to the learning process and will not be tolerated. Certain types of harassment are against public law, policy or regulation, such as harassment due to race, religion, national origin or gender. However, any behavior that is disruptive to the class or hinders the learning experience of the faculty, staff, or students will not be tolerated and could also lead to disciplinary action for faculty and staff or dismissal from the course for students. Students, staff, and faculty alike should treat each other with dignity and respect. The AFIT policy is that learning requires a supportive environment, and no harassment of a personal nature will be tolerated.

<h3>Student Rights</h3>

As a student in an AFIT PCE course, certain rights are conferred to you. For any adverse action taken against you, it is your right to appeal. Per Air University memo "Policy Regarding Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Grievances" dated 7 June 2012 students have the right to formally present grievances or complaints in writing. Formal complaints are to be addressed at the lowest authority level possible, but may be elevated through the chain of command or supervisory channels if necessary. If an appeal is not resolved at the current level, inform the level's representative of your intention to elevate the appeal to the next level.

The chain of appeal follows this order:

1. Course director
2. SPDP Program Director
3. Department Head
4. AFIT School of Systems and Logistics Dean
5. AFIT Director and Chancellor (decisions made at this level are final)
